    "- **atributes of arrays** - determining the size, shape, memory consumption, and data types of arrays\n",
    "- **indexing of arrays** - getting and setting the value of individual array elements\n",
    "    - in a one dimensional array, you can access the ith value (counting from zero) by specifying the desired index in square brackets, just as with Python lists\n",
    "    - to index from the end of the array you can use negative indices\n",
    "    - in a multidimensional array, you can access items using a comma-seperated tuple of indices\n",
    "- **slicing of arrays** - getting and setting smaller subarrays within a larger array\n",
    "    - Just as we can use square brackets to access individual array elements, we can also use them to access subarrays with the slice notation, marked by the colon `:` character. \n",
    "    - `x[start:stop:step]`\n",
    "        - if any of these are unspecified, they default to the values start=0, stop = size of dimension, step = 1\n",
    "        - a potentially confusing case is when the step value is negative\n",
    "    - multidimensional slices work in the same way, with multiple slices seperated by commas\n",
    "    - to access a single row or column of an array you can combine indexing and slicing using an empty slice marked by a `:`\n",
    "    - one important thing to know about array slices is that they return views rather than copies of the array data. \n",
    "        - this default behavior is actually quite useful: it means that when we work with large datasets, we can access and process pieces of these datasets without the need to copy the underlying data buffer\n",
    "            - this is one area in which NumPy array slicing differs from Python list slicing: in lists slices will be copies \n",

    "Because Python is so readable you can usually gain another level of insight by reading the source code of the object you're curious about. `??` can give a quick insight into the under the hood details. Sometimes you will notice that `??` does not display source code. This is generally because the object in question is not implemented in Python, but in C or some other language. If this is the case `??` will give you the same output as `?`. "

If there is only a single option, pressing the Tab key will complete the line for you. Tab completion is also useful when importing objects from packages. "

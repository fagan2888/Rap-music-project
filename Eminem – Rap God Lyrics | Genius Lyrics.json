        "“Rap God” is Eminem’s braggadocious ode to himself and his career. Over its six-minute run-time, he references comic books, throws back to his old songs, and raps crazily fast.",
        "In a Q&A with MSN Music Em was asked whether he felt like a Rap God or an underdog, to which he responded with:",
        "I think everything switches back and forth from hour to hour, day by day with me. That whole ‘Rap God’ record pretty much from top to bottom is tongue in cheek. So I mean, do I want to feel like that? Maybe sometimes. Again, it goes back to everybody who competitive raps and does this for just purely the sport of it wants to be the best. Again, that’s why Kendrick’s verse worked so well because he only said what every rapper’s already thinking, If you don’t want to be the best, then why are you rapping?",
        "This song landed Eminem a spot in The Guinness Book of World Records: Most words in a hit single:",
        "The single ‘Rap God’ from Eminem packed a mouth-filling 1,560 words into its 6 min 4 sec runtime.",
        "However, in 2015 Harry Shotta broke Eminem’s world record of most words in a track. Eminem’s “Rap God” has 1560 words, while Harry Shotta’s “Animal” has 1771.",

        "In a conversation between producer DVLP and Eminem, the rapper spoke about the beat:",
        "Dude, I swear this is one of the illest beats I’ve ever heard",
        "In a 2009 interview with Vibe magazine, Eminem revealed that he believes in God:",
        "Spirituality is definitely a part of that process. They tell you in recovery to pray to your higher power–God is my higher power and He always has been. I definitely pray a lot more than I used to. I don’t feel like I’m crazy wacky religious where I’m at church four days a week or anything like that–not to say that that’s a bad thing for anyone who wants to do that. But I do believe in God, and I do pray.",
        "Lately, Em has shown his spirituality more openly in his music.",
        "In total, Eminem name drops 22 people, with three people being mentioned more than once. He name drops Bill Clinton, Monica Lewinsky, Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, Tupac, N.W.A, Dr. Dre three times, MC Ren, DJ Yella, Eazy E, Run-D.M.C., General Zod, Thor and Odin, Pharoahe Monch, Fabolous three times, Ray J twice, Floyd Mayweather, Heavy D and the Boys, and finally, Satan.",
        "A YouTuber compared the third verse, specifically the speed-rap portion, to other rappers' verses. Up against the likes of Twista, Busta Rhymes, Tech N9ne, and Young Blaze, Em lost the word count, but won the syllable count. There is also a part 2, which offers further comparison.",
        "Eminem was accused of homophobia, thanks to using the slur “faggot” in the first verse and the use of “gay” three times in five lines during verse two. He later responded to the accusations in an interview with Rolling Stone.",
        "Filthy was a major part of Lil Wayne’s Tha Carter II, producing or co-producing “Fireman,” “Hit Em Up” and “Feel Me.”",
        "Filthy also produced “Blunt Blowin'” off Lil Wayne’s The Carter IV.",
        "Ice Cube reacted to Rap God saying this:",
        "That song is lyrically incredible, and thank God, you know. Lyrics still rule the day. No matter how commercialized hip-hop tries to get, or how commercialized people’s vision of hip-hop and b-boys and rappers are, lyrics still rule the day. [Eminem] always delivers, he always gives quality. He’s gonna be around for a long, long time because of that, because he’s a true b-boy. He ain’t no dude that’s just in it for the fringe benefits, he’s in it for the respect.",
        "As Marshall said in this interview, he freestyled the whole thing, so it took just 6 minutes.",
        "Of course this was a joke. Eminem himself said that he doesn’t remember how much time it took.",
        "“Rap God” contains a sample of Dough E. Fresh & The Get Fresh Crew’s “The Show,” as well as a sample from Captain America and the Falcon in: “And a Phoenix Shall Arise!”.",
        "On the third, final verse there’s 804 words. With the verse taking only 3 minutes and 14 seconds, that’s 4.14 words per second!",
        "The guy who Eminem parodies in the suit is a character by the name of Max Headroom, a fictional artificial intelligence character, as well as an icon of pop culture during the ‘80s: originally, he was the main character of a 1987 self-titled satirical science fiction series, but his popularity was mainly boosted by his feature on “Paranoimia”, a song by the British experimental group Art of Noise.",
        "157 syllables in 16.29 seconds averages in about 9.6 syllables per second.",
        "Yes. He recently surpassed the verse in speed with his verse on Nicki Minaj’s 2018 track “Majesty” where he rapped 123 syllables in 12 seconds, .7 syllables faster than the quick segment on the “Rap God” verse.",
        "“Rap God” was certified 4x platinum by the RIAA on February 28, 2018."
